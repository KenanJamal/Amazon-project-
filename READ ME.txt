# Mocked JS Website (Inspired by 22h Course)

This project is my own take on the JavaScript website built in the [22‑hour JS course].  
I followed the main concepts to solidify my understanding, then added extra features and improvements to make it my own.

## 🚀 Features
- **Product Classes**: Base `Products` class with specialized `Clothing` subclass (size chart links).
- **Dynamic Data**: Products fetched from API and instantiated into proper classes.
- **Cart System**: Add, update, delete items with persistent storage in `localStorage`.
- **Delivery Options**: Radio inputs update delivery dates and shipping costs in real time.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Clean use of data attributes for event handling.
